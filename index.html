    <h1>About Spencer</h1>
    <p>I am in Code 201 for JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I know PHP much more than HTML/CSS/JavaScript though.</p>
    <h2>Why I know PHP more than other languages</h2>
    <ul>
    <p>I have been using it off and on for 2-3 years.</p>
    <p>I thought it was more industry standard than I have found now.</p>
    <h2>My goals</h2>
    <p>I would like to learn a lot more HTML/CSS/JavaScript and eventually Python.</p>
    <p>I want to own my own business someday.</p>
    <p>I would like to extend my knowledge of PHP, as well as other languages to broaden my horizons.</p>
