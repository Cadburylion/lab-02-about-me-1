      <h2>A story about when I began programming</h2>
      <p>When I was 12, I was really into flash games and trying to hacking them. I didn't understand at first but after a while I was able to comprehend some of the code and that's when I tried out Visual Basic 6. I made all kinds of simple programs in VB6 which was the spark of my interest in computer programming as I grew up. When I was 13 I made a program that required the user to sign up at a forum that I owned to access it, but the program didn't do anything and ~200 users signed up thinking it would. Someone decompiled my code and posted it online so everyone knew it was nothing; pretty much all my users left and somehow my router got DDOS'd or something which ultimately broke our home internet connection. I didn't understand what happened and my mom was pissed off about it so I stopped programming for a little while. Now I realize that was a ridiculous move and such a bad/deceiving idea. I still don't fully understand why the router completely broke though.</p>
